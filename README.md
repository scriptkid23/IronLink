# IronLink

## Overview

IronLink is a distributed networking library that facilitates the creation of a network of interconnected nodes using the Libp2p protocol. It integrates the Raft consensus algorithm to ensure the synchronization of information across nodes in the network. Additionally, IronLink serves as a library to support the connection between various services configured at the interface layer, enabling seamless communication between different programming languages such as Node.js, Java, etc.

## Features

- **Libp2p Integration**: Utilizes the Libp2p protocol for peer-to-peer communication, enabling nodes to discover, connect, and exchange data securely.
- **Raft Consensus**: Implements the Raft consensus algorithm to achieve agreement among nodes on the state of the distributed system, ensuring fault tolerance and data consistency.
- **Service Integration**: Provides support for connecting various services configured at the interface layer, allowing for interoperability across different programming languages and environments.
- **Scalability**: Scales efficiently with the network size and adapts to changing network conditions, ensuring robust performance even as the network grows.

## Installation

To use IronLink in your Rust project, add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
ironlink = "0.1"
```

## Example

```rust
use ironlink::{
    NodeConfig,
    IronNode,
};

fn main() {
    // Define IronLink node configuration
    let config = NodeConfig {
        libp2p_config: Default::default(),
        raft_config: Default::default(),
        // Add additional configuration options as needed
    };

    // Initialize IronNode with the specified configuration
    let node = IronNode::new(config);

    // Start the IronNode
    node.start();

    // Perform operations on the IronNode (e.g., send messages, query state)
}

```
