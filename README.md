# IronLink

The combination of "Iron" (an icon of Rust) and "Link" (link) signifies the project's role in linking various services.

# Introduction

The API Gateway serves as a central entry point for all external requests to our microservices ecosystem. It is responsible for managing north-south traffic, handling requests from external parties, and routing them to the appropriate microservices. The API Gateway acts as a reverse proxy, building upon existing HTTP proxy products to provide additional features and functionality.

# Features

The API Gateway offers the following key features:

Request Routing: The gateway maps incoming requests to the corresponding microservices based on predefined rules and endpoints.
API Key Management: It provides secure access control by managing API keys and enforcing authentication mechanisms.
Logging and Monitoring: The gateway logs incoming and outgoing requests and provides monitoring capabilities for performance analysis and troubleshooting.
Rate Limiting: It implements rate limiting policies to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of our services.
Developer Portal: The gateway includes a developer portal to provide documentation, API reference, and interactive tools for external consumers.
