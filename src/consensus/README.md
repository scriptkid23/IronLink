# Consensus Layer (Raft)

## Overview

The Consensus Layer, implemented with the Raft consensus algorithm, ensures agreement among nodes in the distributed network regarding the state of the system. Raft provides strong consistency guarantees and leader-based replication to maintain fault tolerance and data integrity.

## Features

- **Leader Election:** Elects a leader node responsible for coordinating consensus decisions.
- **Log Replication:** Replicates logs across all nodes to achieve consensus on data changes.
- **Term-based Consensus:** Divides time into terms to facilitate leader election and log replication.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Tolerates node failures and network partitions while maintaining system availability.
- **Linearizable Reads:** Provides linearizable reads for clients to access the latest committed data.

## Usage

1. **Initialization**: Initialize the Consensus Layer with Raft parameters and configuration options.
2. **Leader Election**: Initiate the leader election process to select the leader node.
3. **Log Replication**: Propagate log entries to other nodes and reach consensus on committed data.
4. **Data Consistency**: Ensure data consistency and integrity by enforcing Raft consensus rules.
5. **Fault Handling**: Handle node failures and network partitions gracefully to maintain system availability.

## Installation

To use the Consensus Layer with Raft in your Rust project, add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
raft = "0.8"
```

## Example

```rust
use raft::{
    Config,
    Node, 
};

fn main() {
    // Define Raft configuration parameters
    let config = Config {
        election_tick: 10,
        heartbeat_tick: 3,
        ..Default::default()
    };

    // Initialize Raft node with a unique ID and configuration
    let node = Node::new(1, vec![1, 2, 3], config);

    // Start the Raft node
    node.start();

    // Perform operations on the Raft node (e.g., append entries, query state)
}

```
