# Network Layer

## Overview

The Network Layer forms the backbone of the distributed network system, responsible for managing communication and connectivity between nodes. It utilizes the Libp2p library, a modular network stack, to enable secure, peer-to-peer communication.

## Features

- **Peer Discovery:** Dynamically discovers and connects to other nodes in the network.
- **Transport Agnostic:** Supports various transport protocols, including TCP/IP, WebSockets, and QUIC.
- **Encryption:** Secures communication channels between nodes using cryptographic protocols.
- **Reliability:** Ensures reliable message delivery and handles network disruptions gracefully.
- **Scalability:** Scales efficiently with the network size and adapts to changing network conditions.

## Usage

1. **Initialization**: Initialize the Network Layer in your application.
2. **Peer Discovery**: Configure peer discovery mechanisms to find and connect to other nodes.
3. **Data Transmission**: Send and receive data packets between connected peers.
4. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling mechanisms to handle network failures and disruptions.

## Installation

To use the Network Layer in your Rust project, add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
libp2p = "0.40"
```

## Example

```rust
use libp2p::{
    identity,
    PeerId,
    tcp::TcpConfig,
    Swarm,
    Transport,
};

fn main() {
    // Generate a new identity for the local node
    let local_key = identity::Keypair::generate_ed25519();

    // Obtain the local peer ID
    let local_peer_id = PeerId::from(local_key.public());

    // Create a TCP transport for network communication
    let transport = TcpConfig::new();

    // Create a Libp2p Swarm to manage connections and communication
    let mut swarm = Swarm::new(transport, MyBehaviour, local_peer_id);

    // Start listening for incoming connections
    Swarm::listen_on(&mut swarm, "/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/0".parse().unwrap()).unwrap();

    // Start the main event loop
    async_std::task::block_on(async {
        loop {
            swarm.next().await;
        }
    });
}
```
